# Usage

Small red/blue squares represent people who get one vote for whatever party color they are. Then district lines are drawn around groups of people and the district backgrounds are colored by which party wins the district.

**Drag** the yellow dot on the "district" (right side) pie chart to gerrymander and change the proportions of districts. This will redraw district lines to make one party more or less favored in representation.

You can also drag the yellow dot on the "population" pie chart to change how many people vote for a certain party. "People per District" and "Number of District" sliders can also be adjusted.
