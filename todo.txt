TODO:
- "Stop Gerrymandering" button
- adjusters flash for a little bit on refresh
- adjuster text postfixes (like "people" or "districts")
- change getScore (in Simulation) to score Map for optimization
    - change score Map when a person swaps districts
    - only call drawDistrictsPieChart() when a district is flipped
    - only recalculate HELP_PARTY when a district is flipped
- allow panning and zooming on mobile (better controls)
- better layout & dynamic
- implement districts pie chart dragging with even grid widths (tied districts)
    - implement two drag points on districts pie chart to make tied section bigger
- add percent to pie charts
- add interface/ui
    - parameter adjusters
    - control panel
- when all red districts are high margin, pick one to try to flip
- district hover information
- speed up simulation drawing
- experiment with trying to keep big districts more cohesive/clumped/less strung out
