TODO:
- change getScore (in Simulation) to score Map for optimization
    - allow population pie chart changing
    - only call drawDistrictsPieChart() when a district is flipped
    - only recalculate HELP_PARTY when a district is flipped
- add timeout for swap manager restarting (sometimes stalls for 9 & 4)
- speed up big grids (81x81) that only do one swap per draw (even though swap time is small but drawing takes long)
- allow panning and zooming on mobile
- better layout & dynamic & fix for mobile
- buttons for new grid, hide districts,
- implement districts pie chart dragging with even grid widths (tied districts)
    - implement two drag points on districts pie chart to make tied section bigger
- add percent to pie charts
- when all red districts are high margin, pick one to try to flip
- district hover information
- speed up simulation drawing
- experiment with trying to keep big districts more cohesive/clumped/less strung out
