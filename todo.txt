- abstract drawPieSlice
- drag districts pie charts to control HELP_PARTY, HINDER_PARTY, and FAVOR_TIE
    - rework swapping (with setInterval)
- implement districts pie chart dragging with even grid widths (tied districts)
- maybe combine pie chart constructor functions
- add percent to pie charts
- refactor pie charts (2 pie chart classes w/ prototype?, 2 instances?)
- change getScore (in Simulation) to score Map for optimization
    - change score Map when a person swaps districts
    - only call drawDistrictsPieChart() when a district is flipped
    - only recalculate HELP_PARTY when a district is flipped
- add interface/ui
    - parameter adjusters
    - control panel
- when all red districts are high margin, pick one to try to flip
- district hover information
- speed up simulation drawing
- experiment with trying to keep big districts more cohesive/clumped/less strung out
