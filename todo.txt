TODO:
- add explanation pop up on start
- buttons for new grid, hide districts, show margins, hide people

User Experience Improvements
- Mobile zoom in can't drag pie charts
- better layout & dynamic (centered, title, etc.)
- add percent to pie charts (on hover?)
- district hover information
- change pie charts to sliders?


Algorithm Improvements
- speed up big grids (81x81) that only do one swap per draw (even though swap time is small but drawing takes long)
- add timeout for swap manager restarting (sometimes stalls for 9 & 4)
- implement districts pie chart dragging with even grid widths (tied districts)
    - implement two drag points on districts pie chart to make tied section bigger
- when all red districts are high margin, pick one to try to flip
- experiment with trying to keep big districts more cohesive/clumped/less strung out
