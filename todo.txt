TODO:
- adjuster text postfixes (like "people" or "districts")
- dynamic line width
- change getScore (in Simulation) to score Map for optimization
    - change score Map when a person swaps districts
    - only call drawDistrictsPieChart() when a district is flipped
    - only recalculate HELP_PARTY when a district is flipped
- speed up big grids (81x81) that only do one swap per draw (even though swap time is small but drawing takes long)
- allow panning and zooming on mobile (better controls)
- better layout & dynamic & fix for mobile
- implement districts pie chart dragging with even grid widths (tied districts)
    - implement two drag points on districts pie chart to make tied section bigger
- add percent to pie charts
- when all red districts are high margin, pick one to try to flip
- district hover information
- speed up simulation drawing
- experiment with trying to keep big districts more cohesive/clumped/less strung out
